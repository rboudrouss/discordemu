# You wanna play pokemon on discord ?
this project is made for you !

# Installation :

1. Install `PyBoy`, you'll find the installtion guide [here](https://github.com/Baekalfen/PyBoy/wiki/Installation).
2. Install `discord.py` : __`pip install discord`__
3. uncoment lines 8 and 9 on [bot.py](https://github.com/rboudrouss/discordemu/blob/master/bot.py) and add your own bot token and testers' ids
4. Add a folder named "roms" where you'll store all your roms. And edit the utils/game/game.py to run your game

(just one of my bad ideas yet again)
